Excited to announce that I'm joining **Granica** as a Machine Learning Engineer! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

This role represents a perfect opportunity to apply my Stanford AI education to real-world machine learning challenges. I'll be working on enhancing person-name classification systems using cutting-edge technologies including ChatGPT and RoBERTa in innovative teacher-student setups.

Key focus areas:
- **Advanced NLP**: Working with diverse data types (JSON, HTML, Free-text)
- **Model Optimization**: Implementing teacher-student learning architectures
- **Performance Engineering**: System speed optimization through heuristics, batching, and caching
- **Production ML**: Deploying scalable machine learning solutions

Looking forward to contributing to Granica's mission and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning! ðŸš€
