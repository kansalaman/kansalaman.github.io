Excited to announce that I'm joining **Granica** as a Machine Learning Engineer! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

This role represents a perfect opportunity to apply my Stanford AI education to real-world machine learning challenges. I'll be working on language models for data anonymization, developing Granica's data de-identification product that enables enterprises to mask PII data for algorithm training compliance.

Key focus areas:
- **Data De-identification**: Leading ML development for enterprise PII masking solutions
- **Model Optimization**: Implementing teacher-TA-student training frameworks using commercial LLMs for silver labeling and T5/BERT distillation
- **Performance Engineering**: Achieving significant inference speedups through smart server-side batching and advanced optimization techniques
- **Production ML**: Migrating from regex-based systems to finetuned contextual phrase embeddings from open source LLMs

Looking forward to contributing to Granica's mission and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning! ðŸš€
