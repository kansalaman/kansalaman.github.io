I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in AI, currently building innovative solutions at [Parallel Web Systems Inc.](https://parallel.sh/) as an early engineer. My research in artificial intelligence has been published in top-tier conferences including **NeurIPS** and **ICASSP**.

I hold a **Master's in Computer Science** with AI concentration from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) and a **Bachelor's in Computer Science** from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). Throughout my academic journey, I've been recognized with prestigious awards including the Charpak Lab Scholarship, Institute Academic Prize, and NTSE Scholar.

My professional experience spans across leading technology companies including previous roles at [Granica](https://granica.ai/) where I enhanced person-name classification systems using ChatGPT and RoBERTa, achieving 1.5x recall and 3x precision improvements, and [Samsung Electronics](https://www.samsung.com/) where I developed diagnostic data analysis software for performance optimization.

I'm passionate about solving complex technical challenges and developing innovative AI solutions that create meaningful impact. My expertise includes machine learning, deep learning, computer networking, reinforcement learning, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). I'm always open to collaborating with fellow researchers and engineers who share a passion for pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence.
